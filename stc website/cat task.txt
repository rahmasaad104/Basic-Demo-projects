my sub-circle is reverse engineering. this means that I need to know best about malwares and how to analyze them ,deal with them and create tools to neutralize them or know how to use the tools that are already made by others since reverse engineering is all about finding out how an object or system works. In order to do all that I need to be a pro with using Linux because it provides a good platform for reverse engineering. There are enough tools available and some come even preinstalled. For more advanced dynamic or static analysis, there are specialized tools available. You can also make the best tools with it because it is an open source operating system. Most of the Internet is powered by Linux, as are all of the world's top 500 supercomputers which makes it more important . Also Linux offers advanced security features. Its multi-user architecture helps restrict each user’s operations. This way, a user can’t modify or damage anything beyond their own files. so far, it is much less vulnerable to viruses and malware compared to other operating systems. To successfully perform reverse engineering, I need a basic understanding of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) as they relate to networks, as well as how these protocols can be sniffed or eavesdropped and reconstructed because to use reverse engineering you need to see through the lens of an attacker, how to expose the vulnerability of a network protocol and exploit the vulnerability, and then discuss how to mitigate attack on the identified vulnerability.
